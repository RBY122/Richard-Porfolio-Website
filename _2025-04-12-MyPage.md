I am methodical and resilient, preferring structured, step-by-step learning and problem-solving. My journey in tech is fueled by a deep curiosity and a commitment to building systems that matter. I’m currently developing foundational skills in ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core, with a strong focus on creating meaningful applications, such as BloodBridge, a blood donation platform designed to address real-world healthcare challenges.
I thrive in environments that require persistence and adaptability. Whether it's configuring development environments, resolving navigation and database mapping issues, or rebuilding lost projects from scratch, I approach each challenge with patience and a growth-oriented mindset. I believe that setbacks are opportunities to deepen understanding, and I’m not afraid to start over if it means mastering a concept thoroughly.
My interest in web development is evident in my practical, hands-on approach to learning. I enjoy dissecting systems, understanding how each component interacts, and refining interfaces to enhance user experience. I’m especially drawn to modular design, responsive UI/UX, and accessibility, ensuring that the solutions I build are inclusive and intuitive.
In parallel, I’m cultivating a strong interest in data science, recognizing its power to uncover insights and drive informed decisions. I’m exploring tools like Power BI, SQL, and Excel, and I’m eager to expand into areas like data visualization, predictive analytics, and machine learning. My goal is to integrate data-driven thinking into the systems I build—whether it's optimizing blood donation logistics or enhancing educational platforms.
Beyond the technical, I’m passionate about using technology to empower communities. I see both web development and data science not just as skills, but as tools for impact—whether through educational platforms, healthcare systems, or collaborative outreach initiatives. My character reflects persistence, problem-solving, and a genuine enthusiasm for mastering the craft of software development and data analytics with purpose.
